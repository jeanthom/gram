# gram

gram is an nMigen+LambdaSoC port of the [LiteDRAM](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litedram) core by [enjoy-digital](http://www.enjoy-digital.fr/). It currently only targets ECP5+DDR3.

## Requirements

nMigen + nMigen-SoC + LambdaSoC

gram requires nMigen "master", as nMigen 0.2 has some nasty bugs that makes it emit buggy RTLIL.

# Development

## Unit tests

The complete suite of unit tests can be launched using the [contrib/test](../contrib/test) script.

## Complete simulation

A complete system with a DDR3 model can be simulated using the scripts in the [simulation folder](../gram/simulation/). Those simulations are quite slow (a couple of hours for emulating a few ms). [More informations in the README...](../gram/simulation/README.md)
